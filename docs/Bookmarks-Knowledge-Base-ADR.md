# Bookmarks Knowledge Base - Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This document tracks architectural decisions made during the development of the Bookmark Knowledge Base system.

## ADR-001: Complete Notion Integration with Page Body Content and Error Handling

**Date:** December 27, 2025

**Status:** Implemented and deployed (commit 9dd4593)

### Context

The Bookmark_Processor n8n workflow was interrupted during initial implementation, leaving gaps in the Notion integration. The workflow could update page properties but was missing:

1. Page body content (AI Analysis, Transcript, Visual Analysis, Code Snippets, Music Recognition)
2. Sync Status property mapping
3. Error handling with notifications

### Decision

Complete the implementation by adding:

#### 1. Page Body Content Flow - 6 new nodes

| Node | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Get Page Blocks` | Fetch existing blocks from page |
| `Prepare Delete Blocks` | Prepare block IDs for deletion (clear before replace) |
| `Build Page Blocks` | Create Notion block objects for rich content |
| `Has Page Content?` | Conditional check for content |
| `Append Page Content` | PATCH /blocks/{id}/children API call |
| `Skip Page Content` | Pass-through when no content |

#### 2. Error Handling Branch - 5 new nodes

| Node | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Set Error Status` | Sets Notion Status property to "Error" |
| `Add Error to Page` | Adds red callout block with error details |
| `Send Error Email` | Emails roy@royengel.com on failures |
| `Build Error Response` | Formats error JSON |
| `Respond with Error` | Returns 500 status |

#### 3. Property Mappings

- Added `Sync Status = "Not Synced"` to Build Notion Payload node

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Workflow now has 21 nodes (up from 10)
- Full enrichment data now appears in Notion page body with proper formatting:
  - AI Analysis (heading + paragraph)
  - Transcript (heading + paragraph)
  - Visual Analysis (heading + paragraph)
  - Code Snippets (heading + code blocks)
  - Music Recognition (heading + bulleted list)
- Processing failures are now visible in Notion (Status = Error, red callout in page)
- Email notifications alert on failures
- Sync Status property enables external sync integrations (see [notion-workspace](../../notion-workspace))

**Trade-offs:**

- Increased workflow complexity (21 vs 10 nodes)
- Additional API calls per bookmark (get blocks, delete blocks, append blocks)

## ADR-002: Notion API Text Length Limit Handling

**Date:** December 28, 2025

**Status:** Implemented

### Context

The Notion API enforces a **2000 character limit** per `rich_text` content block. When processing video transcripts or long-form content, the `Build Page Blocks` node was generating blocks that exceeded this limit, causing API errors:

```
body.children[7].toggle.children[0].paragraph.rich_text[0].text.content.length
should be ≤ 2000, instead was 2360
```

This caused the workflow to fail on videos with longer transcripts (typically 2+ minutes of speech).

### Decision

Added text chunking logic to the `Build Page Blocks` node:

#### 1. New `splitText()` Helper Function

```javascript
function splitText(text, maxLength = 2000) {
  if (!text || text.length <= maxLength) return [text];

  const chunks = [];
  let remaining = text;

  while (remaining.length > 0) {
    if (remaining.length <= maxLength) {
      chunks.push(remaining);
      break;
    }

    // Find last space before limit (word boundary)
    let splitAt = remaining.lastIndexOf(' ', maxLength);
    if (splitAt === -1 || splitAt < maxLength / 2) {
      splitAt = maxLength; // Force split if no good space
    }

    chunks.push(remaining.substring(0, splitAt));
    remaining = remaining.substring(splitAt).trim();
  }

  return chunks;
}
```

#### 2. Updated Block Generation

- `parseContentToBlocks()` now splits long paragraphs into multiple paragraph blocks
- `parseMarkdown()` truncates individual rich_text elements to max length
- List items are truncated to prevent overflow

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Workflow now handles transcripts of any length
- Text splits at word boundaries for readability
- No data loss - all content is preserved across multiple blocks

**Trade-offs:**

- Long transcripts appear as multiple paragraphs within toggles (visually acceptable)
- Slightly more blocks per page for long content
