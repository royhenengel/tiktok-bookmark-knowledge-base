<work_remaining>
## High Priority
1. **Raindrop.io Bidirectional Sync** - NOT IMPLEMENTED
   - The `Sync Status` property exists in Notion but sync workflows are not built
   - Need `notion-to-raindrop` workflow
   - Need `raindrop-to-notion` workflow
   - Need conflict resolution logic

## Medium Priority
2. **Backlog Processor Workflow** - NOT IMPLEMENTED
   - Mentioned in ARCHITECTURE.md but not in workflow list
   - Should batch process unprocessed bookmarks (Status = "Inbox")

3. **Error Recovery** - Partial
   - Email notifications work
   - No automatic retry mechanism for recoverable errors

4. **Podcast Index RSS Fallback** - TODO in code
   - `/video-enricher/main.py:225` has TODO for Podcast Index fallback
   - Currently fails if episode not found on YouTube

## Low Priority
5. **YouTube Cookie File Support** - Not implemented
   - Error message mentions YOUTUBE_COOKIE_FILE but not implemented
   - Would help with bot detection issues

6. **Rate Limiting** - Not implemented
   - ARCHITECTURE.md mentions batch processing with rate limits
   - Current system processes one at a time
</work_remaining>

<attempted_approaches>
## Spotify Podcast Support Evolution
1. **First attempt**: oEmbed API only
   - Limited metadata (title, thumbnail only)
   - Commit `21c2f4e`

2. **Improvement**: Spotify Web API integration
   - Full metadata (description, duration, show info, publisher)
   - Token caching for efficiency
   - Commit `781ea57`

3. **Transcription approach**: RSS feed via iTunes API
   - Search iTunes for show → get RSS URL
   - Parse RSS feed to find episode audio URL
   - Transcribe with AssemblyAI
   - Works for publicly-accessible podcast audio

## Bot Detection Issues
- YouTube download sometimes blocked by "Sign in to confirm" bot detection
- Attempted mitigation: Multiple player clients (iOS, Android VR, TV)
- Suggested but not implemented: Cookie file, residential proxy

## Notion Text Limits
- Initial implementation failed on long transcripts (>2000 chars)
- Fixed with `splitText()` helper function (ADR-002)
- Splits at word boundaries to preserve readability
</attempted_approaches>

<critical_context>
## API Keys Required (stored in Cloud Function env vars and n8n credentials)
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Google Gemini 2.0 Flash
- `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY` - Audio transcription
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` / `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` - Spotify Web API
- `RAPIDAPI_KEY` - TikTok fallback (hardcoded default exists)
- Notion integration token (in n8n)
- Google Cloud service account (in Cloud Functions)

## GCP Resources
- Project: `video-processor-rhe`
- Region: `us-central1`
- Storage Bucket: `video-processor-temp-rhe`
- Cloud Functions: `video-downloader`, `webpage-enricher`

## Design Principles (from ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Cloud Functions: Processing & Intelligence only
- n8n: Orchestration & Data Movement only
- Notion: Rich Data Storage & UI
- Raindrop: Lightweight Sync & Mobile Access

## Notion 2000-char Limit
- All rich_text content must be split into chunks < 2000 chars
- `splitText()` function in Build Page Blocks node handles this
- Long content appears as multiple paragraph blocks within toggles

## Cost Per Bookmark
- Video: ~$0.017 (Gemini + AssemblyAI + ACRCloud + Cloud Function)
- Webpage: ~$0.011 (Gemini + Cloud Function)
</critical_context>

<current_state>
## Working Features
- New Notion bookmark → automatic enrichment via webhook
- Video processing (TikTok, YouTube) with transcription and Gemini analysis
- Webpage processing with type detection and AI analysis
- Spotify podcast episode support with transcription
- Page body content with toggle formatting
- Error notifications via email
- **ACRCloud music recognition** - Videos now route through Video Processor (fixed Dec 29, 2025)
- **Google Drive upload** - Videos saved to "TikTok Videos" folder (fixed Dec 29, 2025)

## Active Workflows
- `Bookmark Processor` (21 nodes) - Primary processor
- `Video Processor` (15 nodes) - Video-specific processing
- `GitHub to Notion Sync v3` (18 nodes) - GitHub integration
- `Notion to GitHub Sync` (8 nodes) - Bidirectional GitHub sync

## Not Yet Implemented
- Raindrop.io sync (both directions)
- Backlog processor for bulk processing

## Git Status
- Branch: `main`
- Clean working tree
- Last commit: `781ea57` (Spotify Web API support)

## Open Questions
1. ~~Is ACRCloud music recognition actually implemented?~~ **ANSWERED: Yes, in Video Processor workflow**
2. ~~Is Google Drive upload working?~~ **ANSWERED: Yes, in Video Processor workflow (folder: TikTok Videos)**
3. ~~Should Bookmark Processor call Video Processor for videos?~~ **FIXED: Dec 29, 2025 - Updated "Detect URL Type" node to route videos to Video Processor webhook**
</current_state>

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Implement Raindrop Sync** - Primary missing feature from original spec
   - Create `notion-to-raindrop` workflow
   - Create `raindrop-to-notion` workflow
   - Implement conflict resolution logic
2. **Build Backlog Processor** - For batch processing unprocessed bookmarks
   - Query Notion for Status = "Inbox"
   - Process in batches with rate limiting
3. **Add Error Recovery** - Automatic retry for recoverable errors

## Recently Fixed (Dec 29, 2025)

- **Connected Bookmark Processor to Video Processor** - Videos from Notion now properly route through Video Processor workflow, enabling ACRCloud music recognition and Google Drive upload
- **Fixed data format compatibility** - Updated "Normalize Results" node to handle Video Processor output format:
  - Title: Now uses `generated_metadata.title` (GPT-4o-mini) instead of parsing Gemini analysis
  - Music: Extracts `recognized_songs` array from music object for proper toggle display
